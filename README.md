Realise not everyone has pro-versions of models, so just in case you'd find it useful, here's a git repo with a few bits of mostly generated content https://github.com/ssfgreen/ANLP-Exam-Revision-2025/tree/main (I tested against gemini, chatGPT and claude) ChatGPT seems the best at notes and examples, Gemini best at summarising / condensing, claude good for mapping (i.e - exam content to lectures).

- / Exam Notes - By section (is ChatGPT generated notes expanding the Exam Guidance 2025)
- / Exam Practice - By section (is ChatGPT generated exam questions mirroring the style of 2019,2024-2025 + tutorial q's)
- / Toy Examples - A toy example dataset that I wanted to use + think through problems (also ChatGPT generated)
- ANLP Lecture Notes - This was generated initially by Gemini incrementally based upon slides + lecture transcripts, but I've been through it all by hand now, so is a decent summary / text based reference for each lecture.

**Caveat, other than the lecture notes, I've not properly sanity checked these.**

_BUT - I'm working through creating notes by hand now (going through the guidance myself) and I'm finding it helpful having the following open while I do it: Lecture Notes + Exam Notes + Toy Worked Examples._

If I get through all of this by hand in time, I'll try doing some of the questions.

Wishing you all happy revising!
